 from textblob import TextBlob
def sentiment_analysis(text):
    analysis = TextBlob(text)
    if analysis.sentiment.polarity > 0:
        return "Positive"
    elif analysis.sentiment.polarity == 0:
        return "Neutral"
    else:
        return "Negative"

text = input("Enter a text string: ")
sentiment = sentiment_analysis(text)
print("Sentiment:", sentiment)

Task
The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, a  and b. Add code to print three lines where:
The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
The third line contains the product of the two numbers.
